# 🚀 Favorite Projects
## [Airwaves and Beats](https://github.com/rmejia4209/Airwaves-and-Beats)
This app plays lofi beats over live air traffic control. It's inspired by
[Lofiatc](https://www.lofiatc.com/?icao=panc), which has been down since
[LiveATC](https://www.liveatc.net) blocked its traffic.

I built this project to explore the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
by creating a simple, framework-free frontend. The backend uses Express to
serve media and a proxy to stream the air traffic control feed.
