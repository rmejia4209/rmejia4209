# 🚀 Favorite Projects
## [Rock Radar](https://github.com/rmejia4209/Rock-Radar)
Rock Radar
A PyQt5 desktop application that helps climbers compare rock climbing crags by
filtering and sorting routes based on route metrics and density. The app
leverages BeautifulSoup for web scraping and QThreads for smooth background
processing, ensuring a responsive user experience.
## [Airwaves and Beats](https://github.com/rmejia4209/Airwaves-and-Beats)
This app plays lofi beats over live air traffic control. It's inspired by
[Lofiatc](https://www.lofiatc.com/?icao=panc), which has been down since
[LiveATC](https://www.liveatc.net) blocked its traffic.

I built this project to explore the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
by creating a simple, framework-free frontend. The backend uses Express to
serve media and a proxy to stream the air traffic control feed.
